Making composite molds with 3D scanning? Check. Performing internal engine surveys with a borescope and real-time fleet insight with "360° Fleet Status"? At E&amp;M, it's daily business. With a good dose of humor - but professionally serious and passionate - we move mountains together. And the customer? They are just as happy as we are, when a component or aircraft leaves the hangar after an overhaul or a check.</span><br class="style-8" /><a href="https://www.afiklmem.com/en" class="style-9">Read more...</a></div>

                <div class="style-24"><span class="style-25">KLM Engine Services also maintains the engines of the newest aircraft of the KLM fleet: The Boeing 787. This aircraft uses the GEnx engine. This engine is more fuel efficient and quieter by innovations like using composite fan blades with titanium leading edges. The air mass flow through this engine in take-off thrust setting is 1190 kg per second. From the outside, this engine displays soft curves and streamlines shapes, but open it and you will find that this engine exists of 75.000 parts that must come precisely together to make the final product. It was amazing to bring the interns of KLM from different backgrounds (e.g. engineering, business, finance &amp; law) together to share our stories and witness how another department operates at KLM.</span><br class="style-26" /><a href="https://www.afiklmem.com/en/engines/engines-solutions-context" class="style-27">Read more...</a></div>
